webapi:
websocket/http
speech rec, tts, nlu, voice biometric
webtool(nes) to build your own

AI:
automating learning to optimize chances of success towards achieving a particular goal

Learning:
Collect Data, Train, Validate, Publish
ideally eliminating validation by making it trivial; typically done by someone, but maybe automated eventually so it can do it itself

Building Virtual Assistant Speech-Powered App:
1. Listen
2. Transcribe/Recognize
3: understand, funnel it - narrowing down on what the user means - NLU
4. Dialog - interaction out
every step requires feedback; expensive for speech recognition because need live transcriptions by humans to verify
